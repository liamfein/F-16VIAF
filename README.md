Current FGAddon version: 3.71 Suitable for: FlightGear 2020.3.x and 2020.4.0

The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon (nicknamed Viper by pilots) is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft in use by the United States Air Force and exported to many countries, becoming world's most numerous fixed-wing aircraft in military service. Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft. The Fighting Falcon has key features including a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, a seat reclined 30 degrees to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it a nimble aircraft.

Includes the following Aircraft variants:

F-16C Block 40 (CCIP) Netz
F-16C Block 50 Barak
F-16I Block 60 Sufa

Each Block has slight differences regarding engine specifics, FBW system, aerodynamics, cockpit layout, available liveries[1] and payloads[2].
